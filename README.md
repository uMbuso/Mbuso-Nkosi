👋 Hi, My name is Mbuso Nkosi

👀 I'm interested in exploring the limitless world of software development, from crafting elegant code to building innovative applications that make a difference.

🌱 I'm currently learning the ropes of the .NET framework and delving into the versatile world of Java. My journey as a student pursuing a BSc in Information Technology at Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology has ignited my passion for coding and problem-solving.

💞️ I'm eager to collaborate with fellow developers, exchange ideas, and work on exciting projects that challenge my skills and broaden my horizons.
